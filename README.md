# NYC-Bullying-Data

This project contains data on incidents of discrimination and harassment occurring in NYC schools during 2016-17. This project aims to understand the causes of bullying in American schools, particularly that of individual traits or physical differences. With this information, the research aims to bring light to the following questions: What (if any pattern exists) people are more likely to become victims of bullying and aggression? In the nature vs nurture dichotomy, is bullying the latter, or is it both, but impacted more by having certain traits that are not evolutionary advantages for humans? Please check out my website above for findings and more information.

The statistics done on this data are written in R. The location of this data can be reached here: http://www.p12.nysed.gov/irs/school_safety/school_safety_data_reporting.html , created by NYSED.
